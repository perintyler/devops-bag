# Daily PR Summary

Generate a Slack-ready summary of the user's PR activity for today.

## Time zone handling

"Today" always means the user's **local calendar day**, not UTC. All external APIs (GitHub, Linear, Slack) return UTC timestamps. To avoid missing PRs created or closed late in the local day:

1. Compute `TODAY` and `TOMORROW` in local time.
2. Use the date range `$TODAY..$TOMORROW` for all GitHub search queries.
3. After fetching results from **any** source (GitHub, Linear, etc.), compare each item's UTC timestamp against the user's local day boundaries and exclude items that fall outside.

## Quick workflow

1. Set the date using the user's **local time zone** (not UTC). GitHub's `--created` and `--closed` filters use UTC dates, so PRs created late in the day locally may fall on the next UTC date. To catch these, search both today and tomorrow (UTC):

```bash
TODAY="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
TOMORROW="$(date -v+1d +%Y-%m-%d)"
```

Then use date range filters like `--created "$TODAY..$TOMORROW"` and `--closed "$TODAY..$TOMORROW"` in the queries below to capture PRs from the full local day.

2. Opened today (non-drafts):

```bash
gh search prs --author @me --created "$TODAY..$TOMORROW" \
  --json number,title,url,repository,isDraft \
  --jq 'map(select(.isDraft | not))'
```

3. Drafts today (to list under "Tomorrow (drafts)"):

```bash
gh search prs --author @me --created "$TODAY..$TOMORROW" \
  --json number,title,url,repository,isDraft \
  --jq 'map(select(.isDraft))'
```

4. Still open (older PRs that are still in review — not created today):

```bash
gh search prs --author @me --state open --sort updated \
  --json number,title,url,repository,isDraft,createdAt \
  --jq 'map(select(.isDraft | not))'
```

Filter out any PRs already captured by the "opened today" query (step 2) to avoid duplicates. These are PRs created before today that are still open and active.

5. Shipped today and closed today (use `--closed` since `--merged` is unreliable):

```bash
gh search prs --author @me --closed "$TODAY..$TOMORROW" \
  --json number,title,url,closedAt,repository,state
```

Then split the results:
- `state == "merged"` -> Shipped today
- `state == "closed"` -> Closed today

6. For each **closed** (not merged) PR, fetch the last comment to use as the close reason:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/name> --json comments --jq '.comments | last | .body'
```

Truncate the comment to the first line/sentence for display. If it's a bot comment (e.g. linear-linkback), skip it and show no reason.

7. For each PR, fetch the branch name:

```bash
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner/name> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName'
```

If the branch contains a Linear ticket identifier (e.g. `ENG-1234`), use `mcp__linear__get_issue` to fetch the ticket. Append the Linear link after the PR link using format `(<LINEAR_URL|TICKET_ID>)`.

## Output format (default)

Use Slack-native hyphen bullets (no numbering) with emojis:

- `:git-open:` for opened today (non-drafts)
- `:git-review:` for still open (older PRs, not created today)
- `:git-merged:` for shipped today (merged)
- `:git-draft:` for drafts
- `:no_entry:` for closed today (not merged)
- `:ladybug:` for bugs

Bug tagging rule: prefix `:ladybug:` when the title contains "bug" or starts with "fix"/"bug" (case-insensitive).

Output a single flat bulleted list with no section headers. Order: opened (non-draft), in-review (older open PRs), shipped (merged), drafts, closed. Closed always last.

Use markdown link format `[text](url)`. Title is plain text (not bold). Separate title, PR link, and Linear link with ` | `.

```
- :git-open: Title | [PR #123](URL) | [ENG-1234](LINEAR_URL)
- :git-open: :ladybug: Title | [PR #124](URL)
- :git-review: Title | [PR #125](URL) | [ENG-1235](LINEAR_URL)
- :git-merged: Title | [PR #126](URL)
- :git-draft: Title | [PR #127](URL)
- :no_entry: Title — "close reason" | [PR #128](URL) | [ENG-5678](LINEAR_URL)
```

## Clipboard & Slack

After generating the summary:
1. Copy the full formatted output to the clipboard using `pbcopy` (using `[text](url)` markdown links)
2. DM the summary to yourself using the `slack-myself` skill. For the Slack API message, convert links to Slack mrkdwn format: `<url|text>` instead of `[text](url)`
3. Confirm both actions to the user

## Notes

- Default scope is all repos the user can access.
- "Shipped today (merged)" uses `--closed` filtered by `state == "merged"` and can include older PRs.
- No section headers. Single flat list.
- **Dedup**: A PR may appear in multiple result sets. Show it only once, using the most final state. Priority: merged > closed > open (today) > in-review > draft. For example, a same-day turnaround PR appears only as merged, and a PR created today never appears in the in-review list.
- For closed PRs, show the close reason in quotes after an em dash. If no meaningful comment exists, omit the reason.
